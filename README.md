# CISP1020
Programs and notes for an introductory data structures and algorithms class.

# Course Information
The first half of the course uses C-based programs (with the exception of the first lab) and the second half utilizes C++. For the most part, a Linux environment was used, but almost any IDE on any platform should be able to build and run the programs.

# Things Mentioned But Not Covered
There are a few things that were mentioned in the course, but were not tested on. As a result, the explanation for these concepts might be lacking or missing entirely, even if a directory is supposed to have that information.
  - Functions as Parameters in C
  - Enumeration
