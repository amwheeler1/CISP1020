# CISP1020
Programs and notes for an introductory data structures and algorithms class.

# Course Information
The first half of the course uses C-based programs (with the exception of the first lab) and the second half utilizes C++. For the most part, a Linux environment was used, but almost any IDE on any platform should be able to build and run the programs.
