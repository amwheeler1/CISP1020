This lab was a review of C++ for the beginning of the semester. It prompts the user for an input file, reads in the data, and prints out
formatted information based on the input file. The reactionary behavior based on the input file is as follows:
    -If the file does not exist, an error message is printed out.
    -If the file is empty, an error message stating so is printed.
    -If a file containing less than the maximum number entries is read in, the number of entries read in are sorted and printed.
    -If a file containing exactly the maximum number of entries is read in, the entries are sorted and printed.
    -If a file containing more than the maximum number of entries is read in, anything past the maximum number is ignored.

Sorting uses a selection sort and sorts the entries based on the state's name. Input files are assumed to be formatted correctly with no errors
present. The program will not account for errors, but will account for more than the maximum number of entires by ignoring everything past the
maximum entry from the file.

C-strings were used in-leiu of the string data type, even though the program is written in C++. This was a requirement of the lab. Theorhetically,
modification of the program to use the strings data type should not be too difficult, but I've got no plans of doing so.

Building the program can be done using C++ and the included makefile. 'make clean' can be used to remove the generated executable, object files, 
and pre-compiled headers.

The 'src' directory contains the source code and makefile, and the 'tests' directory includes files used to test the program.
